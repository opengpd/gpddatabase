# GPD database 

**Introduction**: This page describes the essentials and provides technical documentation for the project of the database used for studying Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). The project is a collaborative effort of scientists working in this field. The page summarizes [available datasets](data_sets.html), introduces [the format](data_format.html) used, presents [installation](installation.html) and [basic usage](basic_usage.html) of the user interface, and finally, gives insight into [the addition of new data](new_data.html).

**What are GPDs?**: GPDs are advanced tools in particle physics that help us explore the internal structure of hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. GPDs emerge from factorization theorems in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory describing the behavior of quarks and gluons. Studied through exclusive reactions, GPDs allow scientists to understand how quarks and gluons are distributed within hadrons and how they contribute to their properties, such as spin, shedding light on the fundamental structure of matter.

**Mission**: The mission of this project is to provide open access to GPD datasets for researchers around the world, facilitating easier integration of existing and new data into phenomenological analyses. By improving reproducibility, the project aims to help the research community fully adopt open-science standards. In addition, the database can serve as an aggregation point to store benchmarks for theoretical developments, including values derived from new GPD models. This open, accessible resource is designed to accelerate research in the field of GPDs.

**Key Features**: The proposed database is a streamlined, efficient resource for storing both experimental and lattice-QCD data relevant to GPD research. Using a lightweight format based on YAML serialization, the database easily captures essential analysis details, including replica values for advanced statistical work. It supports seamless integration with analysis codes through Python and C++ interfaces, making it a practical tool for researchers working on various aspects of GPD phenomenology.
